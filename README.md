# Adds the Danish/Norwegian letters æ/Æ, ø/Ø and å/Å to a (foreign) keyboard mapping on Windows OS.
## default: 
  - æ on 'a'-key
  - ø on 'o'-key
  - å on 'i'-key (the i has a dot, and the a has a dot)
## Usage:
Run the executable and it will remain persistant.
Use the right Alt (AltGr) together with the intended key. Add Shift to capitalize.

Make a shortcut to the executable, and copy that to 'shell:startup' in File Explorer, to have it startup automatically.
## Todo
- add context menus to allow settings change
- solve CapsLock issue
- use config file to store modifications
- add Danish/Norwegian icon as default
- Add installer
