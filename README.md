# Adds the Danish/Norwegian letters æ/Æ, ø/Ø and å/Å to a (foreign) keyboard mapping on Windows OS.
## default: 
  - æ on 'a'-key (ae -> æ)
  - ø on 'o'-key (the ø looks like o)
  - å on 'i'-key (the i has a dot -> the å has a dot)
## Usage:
Run the executable and it will remain persistant.
Use the right Alt (AltGr) together with the intended key. Toggle CapsLock to capitalize.

Make a shortcut to the executable, and copy that to 'shell:startup' in File Explorer, to have it startup automatically.
## Todo
- add context menus to allow settings change
- solve Shift-key issue
- use config file to store custom settings
- Add installer
